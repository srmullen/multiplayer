About
-----
Currently building out a chat app in order to learn to use websockets. It will support chat rooms that
users can join and leave as they please. This could also be used as an opportunity to learn GraphQL. It needs to work
on mobile devices as well as desktops. So it will use a responsive framework.

TODO
----
- Possibly use Redis for storing history.
- Make sure sessions are stored properly before prod.
- Loading page.
- Layout across devices.
- React Native
- GraphQL
- Redux?
